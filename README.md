# University Project - Routes App

This group project consists on an "app" I developed for the *Desenho de Algoritmos* (DA) class in my second year, second semester in FEUP.

## Description

The project consists of an algorithm that finds the smallest path possible between 2 points A and B.
The path is customizable by the user, that is, the user can choose either:

--> Driving Mode

--> Driving and Walking Mode

The algorithm uses Dijkstras and Priority Queues.

## Features

It includes:

--> Menu system

--> CSV dataset loading

--> Algorithm for calculating routes
